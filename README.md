# Manipulus

An Actionscript 3 library for doing (what I would later learn were) functional programming like things. Created as part of my MFA Thesis in Interactive Design and Game Development at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). I built this over the course of a long series of [interactive experiments](http://manipulus.net/#studies) and as the basis for a concept/prototype of an [interaction prototyping interface](http://manipulus.net/#application).
