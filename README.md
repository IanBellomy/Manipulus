# Manipulus

An Actionscript 3 library for doing functional programming like things in Flash. Created as part of my MFA Thesis in Interactive Design and Game Development at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).

I built this over the course of a long series of [interactive experiments](http://manipulus.net/#studies) and as the basis for a rough idea for an [interaction prototyping interface](http://manipulus.net/#application). The goal was _not_ to "implement" functional programming concepts though. I didn't really even encounter functional programming ideas until towards the end of my thesis.
